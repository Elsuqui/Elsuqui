### Hi there, I'm Gorky!👋

## Welcome to my profile

<p>My passion is software development, I have 4 years of experience working on a variety of projects, 
working in small and medium-sized companies building complex solutions, 
and most of the time as a back-end developer with PHP, Laravel, and other related technologies.</p>

I like my career, always trying to keep updated on new tech that makes me improve as a good professional. 
I consider that responsibility and dedication are two main factors that create a better, professional and personal environment.

There are some activities I like to do in my free time

- Play video games 🎮
- Do workout 🏋🏻
- Running 🏃🏻
